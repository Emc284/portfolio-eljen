            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p<p>About myself, I am Eljen Mae Calunod, but you can call me EL. I was born and raised in the Philippines, in the Visayas region, specifically in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. I was born on April 28, 2002, under the Taurus sign♉.</p>
            <p>I might appear to many people as an introvert, lazy, or stubborn, but once I set my mind to a goal, I can say that I do my best to the fullest. I am willing and eager to learn, especially when it comes to technology, and I am confident in my technical skills. I may seem shy to others, especially when it comes to communication, but I excel in technical or backend jobs.</p>
            <p>I am also an only child. My height is 5'1", and my weight is 60 kg. I love music—I'm not tone-deaf—and I love to dance too. I enjoy arts like painting and digital art. I also edit simple videos and help my mom as a content creator, so I have basic editing skills for both photos and videos. Sometimes, I play mobile games and online games on my PC.</p>
            <p>I also love making money so I can help my family and buy the things I want. My first job was in a call center, and right now, I am currently applying for a new job. I might be new to freelancing or virtual assistance, but I am willing to learn to the best of my ability.</p>
